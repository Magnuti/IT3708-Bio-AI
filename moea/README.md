# Project 3 - Image Segmentation With a Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm

In this project we implement both a simple genetic algorithm (as in the two previous projects) and a **multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA)** for color image segmentation. For the SGA we use a weighted-sum fitness function, while for the MOEA we use [Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/996017).

## Getting started

<!-- TODO fix description and add some images -->

## How to run in VS Code

Open the `./mdvrp` folder as a workspace and run the `App.java` file. Note that it must be run from this workspace for relative paths to work.
